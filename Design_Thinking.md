## 💭 Reflection
### 1. What I gained:
* I learned the 5 stages of Design Thinking (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).
* It enhanced my ability to work in a team and brainstorm creative ideas.

### 2. Suggestions for improvement:
* We could interview more users to get better feedback in the "Empathize" stage.
